1. Login to the server with your username and password

`$ ssh username@tripfab.com`

2. Grab a copy of the project (Just the first time)

`$ git clone git@github.com:cristian0789/TripFab.git`

when asked for the password copy and paste this

`devsrv01pstE31P4W`

keep that password close to you as github will ask you for it everytime you run a "pull" or "push" request
